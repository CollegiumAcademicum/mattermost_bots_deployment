"""Example task — prints a greeting to the bot log channel.

Copy this file and rename it to create a new task.
The filename (without .py) becomes the task's name as shown in !tasks.

Required:
    async def run(driver, args: str = "") -> None   — called by the scheduler and !run

    ``args`` is the text that follows the task name in a ``!run`` command
    (e.g. ``!run example_task hello world`` → args = "hello world").
    It is always an empty string when the task is run on a cron schedule.

Optional:
    DESCRIPTION: str                — shown in !tasks output
